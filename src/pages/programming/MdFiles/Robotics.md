# Robotics

Throughout the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 school years, I have developed the code for the 84075A robotics team at Syracuse High School.

For the 2022-2023 School year, we competed in the Vex VRC Game Spin Up. Using a fairly simple autonomous system, we were able to gain enough skills points to compete in the state competition. While we did not win, it was a very rewarding experience to help build and develop a working robot.

# Over Under 2023 - 2024

In an effort to make Burt ( Our robot ) more customizable and user friendly, numerous systems have been developed over the summer and this school year to aid with that. 

‎

Two of the main systems that fuel Burt's success are his Autonomous System and Odometry System. In the world of robotics, Odometry is the practice of using onboard sensors to determin the robot's location at any given time. The Autonomous system then can read that data and adjust the robot accordingly for propper path driving.

‎

## Path Builder

‎

Instead of manually hardcoding paths into the robot, I have opted for a more variable system. From a website, any member of the team can create and edit autonomous paths. They can then export the path as a ```.json``` file and put it onto the sd card inserted into the robot's brain. By doing this, Burt is able to read the path on bootup and play it back.
