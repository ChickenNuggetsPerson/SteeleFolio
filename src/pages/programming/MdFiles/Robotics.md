Throughout the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 school years, I have developed the code for the 84075A robotics team at Syracuse High School.

# Spin Up
https://github.com/ChickenNuggetsPerson/BestieBotPro
For the 2022-2023 School year, we competed in the Vex VRC Game Spin Up. Using a fairly simple autonomous system, we were able to gain enough skills points to compete in the state competition. While we did not win, it was a very rewarding experience to help build and develop a working robot.
