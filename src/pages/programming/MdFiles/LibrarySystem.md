# Library System

My mother is a 3rd grade teacher at a local elementary. As her classroom libary grows, it is getting harder for her to keep track of all of the books in the library. 

‎

Enter the Library System.

‎

Over the course of the 2023 summer, I developed a fully working library catalog website for my mother. It scans the barcode on the back of any book for its ISBN code, looks up the information, and stores it in the library. Once added to the library, the user can add the book to categories and check out the book to students.
