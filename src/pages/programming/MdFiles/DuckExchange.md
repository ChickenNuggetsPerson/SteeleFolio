For my cybersecurity class, we have a currency called Duck. In an effort to make Duck more competative, I was taksked by my teacher to make a Duck Exchange website. In this website, everyone can see everyone else's Duck values and other categories. Along with showing the data, there are playful ducks that float on the screen and interact with the user and eachother. 

‎

From an Admin page, the admin can adjust anything about the homepage data. They can show and hide whole categories or hide individual categories from specific people. They can also adjust point values, create users, and create categories from the admin page.
